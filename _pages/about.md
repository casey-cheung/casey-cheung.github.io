I'm a PhD candidate in Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Manchester, working in the [Two-dimensional (2D) Materials Nanofabrication group](https://www.rglab.co.uk/) at the [National Graphene Institute](https://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/ngi/) (NGI). My research focuses on designing and fabricating novel micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to study the tribological properties of 2D materials.

Prior to joining the current group, I completed my BSc in Physics ('20) at the University of Hong Kong and MSc in Nanomaterials ('22) at the University of Manchester.
