I'm a PhD candidate in Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Manchester, working in [the Two-dimensional (2D) Materials Nanofabrication group](https://www.rglab.co.uk/) at [the National Graphene Institute](https://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/ngi/). My research focuses on designing and fabricating novel micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to study the tribological properties of 2D materials.
